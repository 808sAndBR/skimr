skimr
=====

The goal of skimr is to provide a frictionless approach to dealing with summary statistics iteratively and interactively as part of a pipeline, and that conforms to the principle of least surprise. 

See our blog post [here](https://rawgit.com/ropenscilabs/skimr/master/blog.html).

Installation
------------

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ropenscilabs/skimr")
```

Features
--------

`library(skimr)` provides summary statistics that you can skim quickly to understand and your data and see what may be missing. It handles different data types (numerics, factors, etc), and returns a skimr object that can be piped or displayed nicely for the human reader. 


``` r
library(skimr)
   
#fill in here
   
```
