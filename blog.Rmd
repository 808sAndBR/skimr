## Overview


## Step-by-step thought process

We started off by brainstorming what we liked about existing summary packages and what other features we wanted. 

We started looking at example data, `mtcars`. 

```{r}
str(mtcars)
summary(mtcars)
```


In Amelia's words: 

> "I like what we get here:" 

```{r summary}
summary(mtcars$mpg) 
```
> "But I donâ€™t like this:"

```{r cars}
summary(mtcars$cyl)
```

> "This is OK:"

```{r}
mosaic::tally(~cyl, data=mtcars) # install.packages('mosaic')
```

> "But this output isn't labeled, not ideal". 

```{r}
table(mtcars$cyl, mtcars$vs)
```

> "I like that this returns 'sd', 'n' and 'missing'"

```{r}
mosaic::favstats(~mpg, data=mtcars) 
```
