## Motivation 

The motivation of this project was to create a frictionless approach to quickly viewing summary statistics as part of a pipeline. There are many existing summary functions, but we found them lacking in one way or another because they can be generic, they don't always provide easy-to-operate-on data structures, and they are not pipeable. 

So at [rOpenSci #unconf17](http://unconf17.ropensci.org/), we created a new package that would let you quickly skim useful, tidy summary statistics directly from a pipe. 

And so we created [`skimr`](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/skimr#skimr). 

In a nutshell, `skimr` will create a `skimr` object that can be further operated upon or that provides a human-readable printout in the console. It presents reasonable default summary statistics for numerics, factors, etc, and lists counts, and missing and unique values. 

## Dev process

- our team members/background in terms of coding
- what we each worked on/collaborated
- how we pulled it all together
- next steps/future (issues for later)

### Step-by-step thought process

We started off by brainstorming what we liked about existing summary packages and what other features we wanted. We started looking at example data, `mtcars`. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
str(mtcars)
summary(mtcars)
```

#### What we like and dislike, in Amelia's words

```{r summary}
# "I like what we get here because mpg is numeric so these stats make sense:" 
summary(mtcars$mpg) 

# "But I donâ€™t like this because cyl should really be a factor and shouldn't have these stats:"
summary(mtcars$cyl)

# "This is OK, but not descriptive enough. It could be clearer what I'm looking at."
mosaic::tally(~cyl, data=mtcars) # install.packages('mosaic')

# "But this output isn't labeled, not ideal." 
table(mtcars$cyl, mtcars$vs)

# "I like this because it returns 'sd', 'n' and 'missing'":
mosaic::favstats(~mpg, data=mtcars) 
```
